You've heard of [Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/). Now feast your eyes on **Fresh Carrots**, a movie browsing app that allows users to browse the latest in Movies, TV, and People. What makes the app unique? Well, I think theres something powerful about words. Paired with a captivating poster, thatâ€™s all you need to invite the audience to click.  

**Fresh Carrots is simple yet functional; and elegant solution to the timeless question: What do I watch?**

With everything I create, I strive to give it a pretty face. Design is essential to me. The basis for this design was to capture the aesthetics of a carrot. Why carrots, you ask? Well, because tomatoes were taken. ðŸ™ƒ

*Note*:  
This app is still a work in progress. It initially started as a project for [CodePath's](https://www.codepath.org/) [Android Development Pathway](https://www.codepath.org/courses/android-development). I'm working to add more functionality. The Plan...
- Add the ability to click into movies/shows/people to display further details. 
- Add search functionality
- Publish app to Google Play Store

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:



- [X] **Choose any endpoint on The MovieDB API except `now_playing`**
  - Chosen Endpoint: [Trending](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/trending/get-trending) Actors
- [X] **Make a request to your chosen endpoint and implement a RecyclerView to display all entries**
- [X] **Use Glide to load and display at least one image per entry**
- [ ] **Click on an entry to view specific details about that entry using Intents**

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [ ] **Add another API call and RecyclerView that lets the user interact with different data.** 
- [X] **Add rounded corners to the images using the Glide transformations**
- [ ] **Implement a shared element transition when user clicks into the details of a movie**

## Notes

Had trouble implementing details screen with intents. 
Confusion with data classes vs classes and @Serial used in lab 4 vs @Serialized used in lab 3

The old funtionality is kept in tact:

- [X] **Make a request to [The Movie Database API's `now_playing`](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/movies/get-now-playing) endpoint to get a list of current movies**
- [X] **Parse through JSON data and implement a RecyclerView to display all movies**
- [X] **Use Glide to load and display movie poster images**

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [X] Improve and customize the user interface through styling and coloring
- [X] Implement orientation responsivity
  - App should neatly arrange data in both landscape and portrait mode
- [X] Implement Glide to display placeholder graphics during loading
  - Note: this feature is difficult to capture in a GIF without throttling internet speeds.  Instead, include an additional screencap of your Glide code implementing the feature.  (<10 lines of code)
