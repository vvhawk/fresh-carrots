You've heard of [Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/). Now feast your eyes on **Fresh Carrots**, a movie browsing app that allows users to browse the latest in Movies, TV, and People. What makes the app unique? Well, I think theres something powerful about words. Paired with a captivating poster, thatâ€™s all you need to invite the audience to click.  

**Fresh Carrots is simple yet functional; and elegant solution to the timeless question: What do I watch?**

With everything I create, I strive to give it a pretty face. Design is essential to me. The basis for this design was to capture the aesthetics of a carrot. Why carrots, you ask? Well, because tomatoes were taken. ðŸ™ƒ

*Note*:  
This app is still a work in progress. It initially started as a project for [CodePath's](https://www.codepath.org/) [Android Development Pathway](https://www.codepath.org/courses/android-development).
